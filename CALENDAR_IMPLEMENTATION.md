## Database Schema

The implementation works with the following appointment table structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE appointments (
    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    patient_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    doctor_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    appointment_datetime DATETIME NOT NULL,
    status ENUM('scheduled', 'completed', 'cancelled', 'rescheduled', 'no_show') DEFAULT 'scheduled',
    type ENUM('in_person', 'virtual') DEFAULT 'in_person',
    reason_for_visit TEXT,
    symptoms TEXT,
    doctor_notes TEXT,
    prescription TEXT,
    meeting_link VARCHAR(255),
    fee DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    is_paid BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    
    INDEX idx_appointment_datetime (appointment_datetime),
    INDEX idx_status (status),
    FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES doctors(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## API Integration

### Updated Appointment Service

The appointment service has been updated to work with the new database schema:

```typescript
interface Appointment {
  id: number;
  patient_id: number;
  doctor_id: number;
  appointment_datetime: string; // ISO datetime string
  status: "scheduled" | "completed" | "cancelled" | "rescheduled" | "no_show";
  type: "in_person" | "virtual";
  reason_for_visit?: string;
  symptoms?: string;
  meeting_link?: string;
  fee: number;
  is_paid: boolean;
  patient?: {
    user: {
      name: string;
      email: string;
      phone_number: string;
    };
  };
}
```

### API Endpoints

#### Doctor Appointments
- `GET /doctor/appointments` - Fetch doctor's appointments
- `GET /appointments/{id}` - Get specific appointment details
- `POST /appointments` - Create new appointment
- `PUT /appointments/{id}` - Update appointment
- `PUT /appointments/{id}/cancel` - Cancel appointment
- `GET /doctors/{id}/occupied-dates` - Get occupied dates for doctor
- `GET /doctors/{id}/occupied-times` - Get occupied times for doctor on specific date

#### Nursing Services
- `GET /nursing-provider/nursing-services` - Fetch nursing provider's services
- `PUT /nursing-services/{id}/accept` - Accept nursing service request
- `PUT /nursing-services/{id}/confirm` - Confirm nursing service request
- `PUT /nursing-services/{id}/reject` - Reject nursing service request
- `GET /nursing-providers/{id}/occupied-dates` - Get occupied dates for nursing provider
- `GET /nursing-providers/{id}/occupied-times` - Get occupied times for nursing provider

- `GET /lab-providers/{id}/occupied-dates` - Get occupied dates for lab provider
- `GET /lab-providers/{id}/occupied-times` - Get occupied times for lab provider

## Integration Steps

### 1. Backend Setup

Ensure your Laravel backend has the updated appointment migration and model:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

The backend now includes:
- Accept/reject endpoints for nursing services
- Occupied dates/times endpoints for all provider types
- Calendar functionality for doctors, nursing providers, and lab providers

### 2. Frontend Dependencies

All required dependencies are already installed:
- `date-fns` for date manipulation
- `@radix-ui/*` components for UI
- `lucide-react` for icons

### 3. Import and Use

#### For Doctor Dashboard
```tsx
import { AppointmentCalendar } from '@/components/calendar';

function DoctorSchedule() {
  const [appointments, setAppointments] = useState<Appointment[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    appointmentService.getAppointments('doctor')
      .then(setAppointments)
      .catch(console.error);
  }, []);

  return (
    <AppointmentCalendar
      appointments={appointments}
      onAppointmentClick={(appointment) => {
        console.log('Selected:', appointment);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

#### For Nursing Provider Dashboard
```tsx
import { AppointmentCalendar } from '@/components/calendar';
import useNursingCalendar from '@/hooks/useNursingCalendar';

function NursingSchedule() {
  const {
    appointments,
    isLoading,
    acceptRequest,
    rejectRequest,
  } = useNursingCalendar();

  return (
    <AppointmentCalendar
      appointments={appointments}
      onAppointmentConfirm={acceptRequest}
      onAppointmentReject={rejectRequest}
    />
  );
}
```

## Usage in Provider Dashboards

The calendar is integrated into multiple provider dashboards:

### Doctor Dashboard
- Route: `http://localhost:8080/provider/doctor`
- Tab: "My Schedule"
- Features: View appointments, appointment details modal, virtual meeting links

### Nursing Provider Dashboard
- Route: `http://localhost:8080/provider/nursing`
- Tab: "My Schedule"
- Features: Accept/reject requests, view occupied slots, prevent double-booking

### Lab Provider Dashboard
- Route: `http://localhost:8080/provider/lab`
- Ready for calendar integration with occupied slots functionality

### Common Implementation Features
1. **Loading State**: Shows spinner while fetching appointments
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures
3. **Click Handlers**: Toast notifications and custom appointment handling
4. **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes
5. **Occupied Slots**: Visual indication of unavailable time slots
6. **Double-booking Prevention**: Prevents scheduling conflicts

## Customization Options

### Color Themes
Modify appointment colors by updating the `getAppointmentModeColor` function:

```typescript
const getAppointmentModeColor = (appointment: Appointment) => {
  const isVirtual = appointment.type === "virtual";
  return isVirtual
    ? "bg-blue-100 text-blue-800"    // Custom virtual color
    : "bg-red-100 text-red-800";     // Custom in-person color
};
```

### Additional Filters
Add custom filters by extending the `FilterType` union:

```typescript
type FilterType = "all" | "today" | "tomorrow" | "week" | "month" | "unpaid" | "pending" | "confirmed";
```

### Provider-Specific Customization
Different providers can customize the calendar for their specific needs:

```typescript
// Nursing provider specific
const nursingCalendarProps = {
  showAcceptReject: true,
  allowStatusChange: true,
  preventDoubleBooking: true,
};

// Lab provider specific
const labCalendarProps = {
  showTestDetails: true,
  allowRescheduling: true,
  showTurnaroundTime: true,
};
```

### Calendar View Options
- Modify `min-h-[100px]` to adjust calendar cell height
- Change grid layout for different calendar sizes
- Add week view or agenda view options

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- **Efficient Date Filtering**: Uses date-fns utilities for fast date comparisons
- **Memoized Calculations**: Prevents unnecessary recalculations
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only renders visible appointments
- **Lazy Loading**: Modal content loaded on demand
- **Custom Hooks**: useNursingCalendar hook for nursing-specific functionality
- **Smart Caching**: Occupied times cached per date to reduce API calls

### Recommended Practices
- Implement pagination for large appointment lists
- Cache appointment data with react-query or SWR
- Use virtual scrolling for very long lists
- Debounce filter changes
- Implement real-time updates with WebSockets for instant calendar updates
- Add offline support with service workers
